# Deathly-Design
A PC game where players can build their monster by choosing which upgrades and weapons they want to equip. And then take their monster into the world and wreak havoc by destroying everything.

This is just a small code sample from the project; the full project is private.

## Narrative
Humanity is dwindling, the world is in ruins, and society is on the verge of collapse… but none of that matters to you. You (a mad scientist) are not concerned with the end of days—you’re enraged by that obnoxious metal blaring from the last radio towers! While the rest of the world crumbles, you're instead obsessed with one final mission: silence that infernal noise once and for all! Fueled by your obsession with classical music and your talent for building monsters, you set out to destroy the towers, and the fans keeping them alive. Create terrifying eldritch horrors or absurdly destructive musical monstrosities, your goal is clear—end the reign of rock and restore the airwaves to the elegance of the classics!

## Design Pillars
1. Monster parts must look “eldritch” or absurd
2. Game/art direction must not take itself very seriously
3. Destruction must feel impactful and grandiose
   
These were specifically chosen to inspire choices leading towards goofy yet horrific destruction.
